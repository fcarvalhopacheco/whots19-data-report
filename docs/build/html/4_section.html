<p>The hydrographic profile observations made during the WHOTS cruises were
obtained with a Sea-Bird CTD package with dual temperature, salinity, and
oxygen sensors. This CTD was installed on a rosette-sampler with 5 L Niskin
sampling bottles for calibration water samples. Furthermore, the ship Oscar
Sette came equipped with a thermosalinograph system that provided a continuous
depiction of the near-surface layer’s temperature and salinity. Horizontal
currents over the depth range of 30-700 m were measured from the shipboard 75
kHz Ocean Surveyor (OS75) ADCP (narrowband) with a vertical resolution of 16m
for the WHOTS-19 and WHOTS-20 cruises. Broadband mode for the OS75 provided
additional current data over the range upper 200 m with a vertical resolution
of 8m.</p>
<p>Data gaps occurred when the system was shut down temporarily during
communications with the acoustic releases used for the moorings during both
cruises. Periods of missing data between 300 and 450 m in the broadband ADCP
were apparent due to the lack of scattering material in the water.</p>

<p>Continuous measurements of temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and
pressure were made with the UH Sea-Bird SBE-9/11Plus CTD underwater units
#91361 and #850 during WHOTS-19 and WHOTS-20 cruises respectively. The CTD was
equipped with an internal Digiquartz pressure sensor and pairs of external
temperature, conductivity, and oxygen sensors.</p>
<p>Each temperature-conductivity sensor pair used a Sea-Bird TC duct, which
circulated seawater through independent pump and plumbing installations. The
CTD configuration also included two oxygen sensors, installed in the plumbing
for each sensor set. In both cruises, the CTD was mounted in a vertical
position in the lower part of a rosette sampler, with the sensors’ water
intakes located at the bottom of the rosette.</p>
<p>The package was deployed on a conducting cable, which allowed for real-time
data acquisition and display. The deployment procedure consisted of lowering
the package to approximately 10 dbar and waiting until the CTD pumps started
operating. The CTD was then raised until the sensors were close to the surface
to begin the CTD cast. The time and position of each cast were obtained via a
GPS connection to the CTD deck box. Four salinity samples were taken on each
cast for calibration of the conductivity sensors.</p>

<p>CTD data were acquired at the instrument’s highest sampling rate of 24 samples
per second. Digital data were stored on a laptop computer, and, for redundancy,
the analog signal was recorded on a separate computer using a sound card and
Audacity (TM) software. Backups of CTD data were made onto USB storage cards.</p>
<p>The raw CTD data were quality controlled and screened for spikes described in

water of its wake. Therefore, the downcast samples were rejected when the CTD
was moving upward or when its acceleration exceeded 0.5 m s-2 in magnitude. The
data were subsequently averaged into 2-dbar pressure bins after calibrating the
CTD conductivity with the bottle salinities.</p>
<p>The data were additionally screened by comparing the T-C sensor pairs. These
differences permitted the identification of problems with the sensors. The data
from only one T-C pair, whichever was deemed most reliable, is reported here.
Only data from the downcast are reported, as wake effects from the rosette
commonly contaminate upcast data.</p>
<p>Temperature is reported on the ITS-90 scale. Salinity and all derived units
were calculated using the UNESCO (1981) routines; salinity is reported in the
Practical Salinity(SA) scale (PSS-78). Oxygen is reported in umol kg-1.</p>

<p>Salinity samples were collected by a rosette sampler during CTD casts at
selected depths during WHOTS-19 and -20, and then sub-sampled in 250 ml glass
bottles. The top of each bottle and thimble were thoroughly dried before being
tightly capped to prevent water from being trapped between the cap or thimble
and the bottle’s mouth. It has been observed that residual water trapped in
this way increases its salinity due to evaporation, and it can leak into the
sample when the bottle is opened for measuring. Samples from each cruise were
measured after the cruise in the UH laboratory using a Guildline Autosal 8400B
SN 70168 for WHOTS-19 and SN 73647 for WHOTS-20. International Association for
Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO) standard seawater samples were measured
to standardize the Autosal, and samples from a large batch of “secondary
standard” (substandard) seawater were measured after every 24-48 samples to
detect drift in the Autosal. Standard deviations of the secondary standard
measurements were less than ± 0.001 for WHOTS-19 and -20 cruises
<a class="reference internal" href="#table-11"><span class="std std-numref">Table 4.1</span></a>.</p>
<p>The substandard water was collected by a rosette sampler from 1020 m at station
ALOHA during HOT cruises and drained into a 50-liter Nalgene plastic carboy. In
the laboratory, the water was then thoroughly mixed in a glass carboy for 20
minutes by manually shaking, rolling, and tilting the carboy vigorously, after
which a 2-inch protective layer of white oil was added on top to deter
evaporation. The substandard water was allowed to stand for approximately three
days before it was used and was stored in the same temperature-controlled room
as the Autosal, protecting it from the light with black plastic bags to inhibit
biological growth. Substandard seawater batch #67 was prepared on August 18,
2019, and it was used for WHOTS-19. The batch #71 was prepared on August 27,
2021, and it was used for WHOTS-20.</p>
<p>Samples from the WHOTS-19 were measured on October 28, 2019 and samples from

<p>Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-19 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG) system installed on the NOAA Ship
Oscar Sette. The sensors were sampling water from the continuous seawater
system running through the ship. They comprised one thermosalinograph
model SBE-21 (SN 3168) and a micro-thermosalinograph model SBE-45 (SN 0290),
both with (internal) temperature and conductivity sensors located in the ship’s
chemistry lab, about 70 m from the hull intake; and an SBE-38 (SN 266) external
temperature sensor located at the entrance of the water intake. All instruments
recorded data every second. The water intake is located at the ship’s bow,
forward from the starboard side bow thruster at a depth of 3 m. The system has
a flow meter in the chemistry lab, showing a flow rate of about 1.1
liters/minute during the cruise. Only the SBE-45 has a debubbler. Salinity
water samples were taken every 8 hours from the exhaust in the Chemistry lab
using 0.25-liter glass bottles, to be measured in the UH lab to correct any

<p>Salinity samples were drawn from the flow-through system, located less than 0.5

<p>In order to make the comparison in conductivity units, the CTD conductivity was

<p>A cubic spline was fit to the time series of the differences between the bottle
